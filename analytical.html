                    Welcome to my professional portfolio. As evident from this site, I possess an interest in digital platforms mostly to complement my primary interest in computational modeling and sociology.
                    <br>

                    To the right, you can quickly access my resume, writing sample, and my GitHub page. Scrolling down, you'll find a chronological showcase of my projects, including key deliverables. I recently left my job at Backroads to focus on developing skills more relevant to my interests—data, people, and spatial analysis. This passion evolved from an honors thesis I completed at Bowdoin College, where I pursued a double major in Computer Science and Sociology. The thesis focused on modeling the city of Atlanta to measure residential segregation and access inequality.

                    <br> 
                    Throughout college, I had diverse internship experiences. The summer before my senior year was spent conducting initial research and method design for my honors. I focused on scraping Google Maps to measure amenity quality by demographic neighborhood in Atlanta. In the summer of 2020, I interned with NASA and JPL, where our team aimed to make the High-Altitude Balloon launch and recovery process continuous and autonomous. I was responsible for predicting balloon landing locations, simulating balloon flight, and accounting for the uncertainty of wind data at each second of the flight using Monte Carlo simulations. This experience was a preceding inspiration for my thinking about cities as complex, probabilistic iterative systems. In previous summers, I’ve been a pottery teacher, climbed Denali on a NOLS course, and worked as a seamstress in a gear room in my hometown in Wyoming.

                    <h3>Urban View</h3>
                    <h4>Decmber 2023 - Present</h4>
                    <p>Currently, I am dedicating the majority of my time to developing a platform named Urban View. This platform aims to serve as a centralized repository for various open-source datasets, including the Census, ACS, OSM, and other significant spatial datasets. My focus has primarily been on establishing the infrastructure for this project. Once the data infrastructure is completed, I will begin developing novel analysis tools for urban planners. These tools are designed to facilitate calculations of multimodal travel times across entire communities, optimization methods for transportation and housing locations, and, more recently, predictive modeling for community growth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have taken a particular interest in Community Scale's (a small urban planning consulting firm) approach to assesing housing needs. Predicting the necessary amount of housing for a community's needs presents a substantial challenge for growing cities and towns. This type of housing analysis seeks to determine what type, where, and at what cost housing is needed for a given community. Ideally, Urban View will enable cross-town and cross-chronology analyses to identify towns similar in time to a studied one and extrapolate the outcomes of these similar towns to the town in question.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Although this project is far from completion, it holds significant value for small towns lacking the resources to attract talent for this work and large cities and consulting firms in need of access to extensive data sets and advanced algorithms.</p>

                    <p> 
                        During my tenure at Backroads as a Demand Planning Data Analyst, my primary responsibility was to forecast demand, optimizing where and when we offered trips to maximize revenue. With a focus on predicting guest counts for both the company at large and individual trips, I also managed penalty tracking and calculated opportunity costs associated with these penalties. My contributions included identifying improvements for our trip catalog, resulting in significant revenue enhancements, and building a historical booking dataset. This dataset, coupled with Monte Carlo simulations, refined our trip assortment accuracy and revenue optimization strategies. My role extended to supporting other departments with data analysis and visualizations for their projects.

                        <br>
In December 2023, I transitioned from Backroads, motivated by a desire to align my career with my passion for urban transit technology.

                    <h3>Senior Honors Project</h3>
                    <h4>August 2021 - May 2022</h4>
                    <p> 
                        In the period from September 2021 to May 2022, I opted to complete an Honors Project in the Sociology Department, which was awarded the Matilda White Riley Prize for outstanding honors. Initially broad in scope, my project sought to explore innovative methods for modeling and optimizing urban environments to mitigate inequality and segregation. My honors resulted in two components both derived from a digital model of the City of Atlanta constructed from ACS, Census, OSM, and other data public data types. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The first component involved graph partitioning Atlanta's road network to measure the demographic homogeneity of its subgraphs. The second focused on simulating multimodal access to amenities from any given residence to every amenity type within the city. Together, these analyses provide insights into the structural and mobility factors contributing to urban segregation.

                        Details and downloadable content for both components are available on the right, with links provided by clicking the respective cards. Additionally, the comprehensive write-up of my honors project is accessible via a link at the top of this page and the card to the right. While the dataset for the multimodal access simulation is extensive, the source code is readily available for review on GitHub, offering a transparent view into the methodologies underpinning this research.

                        <h3>Urban Pastures - Graph Partioning</h3>
                        <p>
                            My honors paper explores the methodology and implications of partitioning Atlanta's road network into subgraphs based on travel difficulty, focusing specifically on residential roads. This approach effectively creates isolated pockets of neighborhoods that are only interconnected only through residential streets, creating distinct groups or "Urban Pastures." By excluding all non-residential road segments, the study reveals a pattern of demographic homogeneity within these structurally isolated neighborhoods. The analysis demonstrates a low standard deviation (<1) across key demographic dimensions—race, educational attainment, and poverty levels—within each urban pocket. This finding underscores the extent to which residents with similar demographic characteristics are confined to specific, structurally isolated areas within Atlanta. The term "Urban Pastures" aptly describes these homogenous, structurally determined subgraphs, emphasizing the role of urban infrastructure in segregating communities.

                        <p> 
                            This component of my Honors was not written up but has broader applications and more significant value for industry. This method was heavy influenced by <em>Spatial Proximity and Connectivity</em>, a paper written by Rice Professor Elizabeth Roberto which developed a nuanced method to measure segregation by thinking about separation measured by distance along the road network. My model adds walk and bike networks to further add nuance to this method. It probabilistically determines likely commute methods from census data and in real time selects the method and determines travel time to all amenities. This model can sample any number of homes in Atlanta and determine the access to amenities or to communities of other demographics. This process could be used as a fitness function for optimization to select the best transit development to offset inequality or identify optimal affordable housing development.
