                <p> My name's Noah and a multi-faceted professional with a keen analytical mind, as evidenced by his role as a 
                    Demand Planning Data Analyst at Backroads, where his insights have led to significant revenue improvements. 
                    His academic foundation in Computer Science and Sociology from Bowdoin College, culminating in a Cum Laude 
                    degree, is further distinguished by an honors project that won the Matilda White Riley Prize. With hands-on 
                    experience at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a history of adventurous leadership demonstrated during a 
                    NOLS expedition to Denali, Noah's blend of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and real-world experience 
                    makes him a standout in data-driven and sociological analysis. His interests, which range from computational 
                    geometry to urban planning, reveal a dynamic individual committed to leveraging technology for social advancement.

                    <h3>Urban View</h3>
                    <h4>Decmber 2023 - Present</h4>
                    <p>Currently, I am dedicating the majority of my time to developing a platform named Urban View. This platform aims to serve as a centralized repository for various open-source datasets, including the Census, ACS, OSM, and other significant spatial datasets. My focus has primarily been on establishing the infrastructure for this project, which, once completed, will offer novel analysis tools. These tools are designed to facilitate calculations of multimodal travel times across entire communities, optimization methods for transportation and housing locations, and, more recently, predictive modeling for community growth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have taken a particular interest in Community Scale's approach to housing needs assessments. Predicting the necessary amount of housing for a community's needs presents a substantial challenge for growing cities and towns. Community Scale engages in this type of research to determine what type, where, and at what cost housing is needed for a given community. Ideally, Urban View will enable cross-town and cross-chronology analyses to identify towns similar in time to a studied one and extrapolate the outcomes of these similar towns to the town in question.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Although this project is far from completion, it holds vast potential applications ranging from small towns lacking the resources to attract the talent required for such work, to large cities and consulting firms in need of access to extensive data sets and advanced algorithms.</p>

                    <p>This project showcases a simplified interactive web map of Teton County's GIS server. Its creation was motivated by Teton Counties search for a GIS administer and to demonstrate my abilites visulize spatial data through the web. The map has not been fully optimized nor have I built all the fuatures the GIS Server would require. It's here to showcase a visulization ability not a my ability devlop nuannced spatial algoritums and analysis. It took me roughly 6 hours to get up and running. </p>

                    <p> 
                        During my tenure at Backroads as a Demand Planning Data Analyst, my primary responsibility was to forecast demand, optimizing where and when we offered trips to maximize revenue. With a focus on predicting guest counts for both the company at large and individual trips, I also managed penalty tracking and calculated opportunity costs associated with these penalties. My contributions included identifying improvements for our trip catalog, resulting in significant revenue enhancements, and building a historical booking dataset. This dataset, coupled with Monte Carlo simulations, refined our trip assortment accuracy and revenue optimization strategies. My role extended to supporting other departments with data analysis and visualizations for their projects.

                        <br>
In December 2023, I transitioned from Backroads, motivated by a desire to align my career with my passion for urban transit technology.
